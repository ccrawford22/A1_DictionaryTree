# Vocabulary Tree Implementation

This project involves the implementation of a tree data structure in C/C++ to store a vocabulary. The tree will be used to perform various 
operations such as inserting words and counting words that start with a specific prefix.

## Implementation Requirements

To ensure proficiency in C/C++ programming, particularly with pointers, the following implementation requirements must be met:

- The tree data structure must be implemented using pointers.
- The data portion of the tree node should only contain pointers to its children.
- The use of the std::string class from the standard template library (STL) is not allowed in the tree operations, specifically in the insert
  and search functions.

## Tree Operations

The project requires the implementation of the following tree operations:

1. Insert a word into the tree: This operation involves adding a word to the vocabulary tree.
2. Count words with a specific prefix: This operation counts the number of words in the tree that start with a given prefix.
